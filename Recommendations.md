# Recommendations
Based on the analysis performed on Python Notebook, below recommendations are suggested. 

## Increase Female Purchases
1. Density of Male customers is significantly higher. 71.7% Customers are Males, 28.3% Customers are Females. Males have higher spread of spending than Females within Q1 and Q3. Female Purchases have more outliers than Men.

2. There is no overlap between Confidence Intervals of Male and Female purchases, Males tend to spend more than Women.

3. Our Hypothesis also proved Men are spending significantly more than women.

4. This suggests there are more products for men, and they are purchasing in wider range. More female products should be included to increase Purchases from women. Special offer for women can also be leveraged.


## Improvement in City wise Purchases

1. 53.3% Customers are in Type C Cities, but only contribute to 32.7% Purchases. Total Purchases can improve if we focus targeting Type C Cities, they have large Customer base that is underpurchasing.

2. Moreover, our Hypothesis testing proved that City C is out-performing in average Purchases, City A can leverage strategies employed in City A.

3. Type A Cities have 17% Customers but they contribute to 26% Sales, Increasing Distribution (Outlets) in Type A will increase total purchases.



## Promote more number of Transactions

1. Average Purchase from High Transaction Count Customers = 1466772.0

2. Average Purchase from Low Transaction Count Customers = 270369.0

3. Average Purchase from High Transaction Count Customers is 442.5% more than Low Transaction Customers

4. Hypothesis Proved - Customers with more number of Transactions tend to spend more.

5. Promoting more number of transactions, by offers that encourages re-buys or re-visits can contribute to surge in total purchases.



## Promote Premium Categories Purchases

1. None of Premium Categories are significantly contributing to total Purchases (not in Top 5 Categories). Including Premium sections in stores or focusing on this Category by other means can increase purchase volumes.


## Reduce Dependency in Product Category 1

1. Product Category 1 alone contributes to 37.5% of Purchases. All other categories contribute to less than 20% of total Purchases

2. Hypothesis Proved â€“ Product 1 Purchases are Higher compared Other Products.

3. Other Product Categories should also contribute equally to total purchases, making Walmart a complete variety store, not depending on any particular Category.
